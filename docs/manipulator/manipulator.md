The main manipulator on the ROV is comprised of a waterproof motor housing containing a 3V 2A NEMA-23 stepper. 
This stepper was chosen as the NEMA series have standard mounting patterns and could allow for the switch to a different motor if necessary. 
The motor housing utilizes a flanged viton oring seal and a ruberized bore and shaft seal for waterproofing. 
the shaft seal prevents leaking around the output shaft of the motor, as well as has an oring to seal the bore, 
not relying on the tolerences of the pressfit of the shaft seal into the bore. An adapter shaft for the output shaft of the motor was made
as the D-shaft output of the NEMA will not seal through a shaft seal.

The end effector of the manipulator subsystem is designed such that it can be modular as well, so long as it accepts a the ouput shaft
adapter and mounts to the bolt pattern. The end effector chosen has a rack and pinion system contained inside a gear housing which, when 
combined with the shape of the fingers being flat on the bottom, will take the weight force of the props to be lifted off of the gearing, 
and to be offloaded into the chassis. This then allows that the only time torque is being applied to the motor is while active gripping.
This then effectively when holding a prop fully conatined within the fingers will effectivly increase the holding capacity of the manipulator
from the holding torque of the motor to the yielding strength of the aluminum gear housing.
